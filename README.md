# Android-Controlled-Robot-Car

The system is built on Verilog language and Arduino UNO hardware. It implements a bluetooth controlled car driven by an
application. It has various functionalities facilitated by the application. The
motors are connected via L293D motor drivers. Motors are connected to
wheels for making the circuit mobile. The ultrasonic sensor is connected on
the rear side so as to warn the user when device is in the proximity of
obstacle. The IR sensors in the front side ensure the obstacle avoidance
when driving forward. There are front LEDS that glow whenever the car is
powered. There is a horn that is controlled by the android application, like
the direction of the car. There is another buzzer which indicates the
proximity of the car to an obstacle i.e. the buzzer will produce sound when
the car is within a certain distance near any obstacle. The application has
an additional functionality of accelerometer which enables the control of car
Other than gesture control. For an instance, when we tilt our mobile in a
specific direction, then car moves swiftly in that particular direction.
